With the next season of Overwatch League being played in an early build of Overwatch 2, Overwatch League teams are looking to hold tryouts in an Overwatch 2-like environment. While some teams have chosen to simply reduce the lobby to 5v5, the Paris Eternal reached out to Elo Hell Workshops to update the SVB Overwatch 2 Workshop. Working closely with the Paris Eternal, Elo Hell Workshops developers have implemented several new changes to the original mode.

The original project was created with the help of notable community figures, such as EeveeA and Bogur, working alongside over eight Workshop developers. Several of those developers returned to continue updating the project into what you see today!
